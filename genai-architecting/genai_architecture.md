## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1️⃣ Learning Portal (Frontend)

The app is divided into several learning modules:

- **🤖 AI Chat Assistant**: Helps with translation and learning tasks.
- **🎮 Educational Games**: Engaging games for practicing English.
- **📚 Reading Exercises**: Practice reading in English.
- **✍️ Translation Practice**: Translate sentences from Spanish to English.

### 2️⃣ Context Building

We use an advanced system (RAG) that integrates:

- **📗 Lesson Database**: A database of lessons for reference.
- **📘 Grammar Database**: Grammar rules to guide learning.
- **📊 Progress Tracking System**: Tracks the user's learning journey.

This system ensures responses are relevant and based on:

- The user’s current level.
- Learning history and progress.
- Relevant materials for further study.

### 3️⃣ Specialized Models

The system uses three main AI models:

- **👨‍🏫 Teacher Model**: Guides the overall learning process.
- **🔄 Translator Model**: Helps with translation exercises.
- **🎮 Game Model**: Manages interactive learning activities.

### 4️⃣ Learning Agents System

AI agents manage:

- **✍️ Personalized Feedback**: Feedback tailored to each user’s progress.
- **📊 Progress Updates**: Keeps track of the student’s learning progress.
- **💡 Gradual Hints**: Provides hints to help the student without giving away answers.

### 5️⃣ Security and Monitoring

We implement:

- **🔒 Authentication**: Ensures secure user access.
- **🛡️ Content Guardrails**: Filters content for appropriateness.
- **📈 Analytics**: Tracks user performance and system usage.

## 🔄 Workflow

1. The user enters the learning portal.
2. Selects an activity (chat, games, reading, practice).
3. The system:
   - Retrieves the student’s learning context.
   - Chooses the right AI model.
   - Applies content guardrails.
   - Generates educational responses.
   - Updates progress and learning path.

## 🛠️ Technical Components
