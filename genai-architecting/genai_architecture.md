## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1️⃣ Learning Portal (Frontend)

The app is divided into several learning modules:

- **🤖 AI Chat Assistant**: Helps with translation and learning tasks.
- **🎮 Educational Games**: Engaging games for practicing English.
- **📚 Reading Exercises**: Practice reading in English.
- **✍️ Translation Practice**: Translate sentences from Spanish to English.

### 2️⃣ Context Building

We use an advanced system (RAG) that integrates:

- **📗 Lesson Database**: A database of lessons for reference.
- **📘 Grammar Database**: Grammar rules to guide learning.
- **📊 Progress Tracking System**: Tracks the user's learning journey.

This system ensures responses are relevant and based on:

- The user’s current level.
- Learning history and progress.
- Relevant materials for further study.

### 3️⃣ Specialized Models

The system uses three main AI models:

- **👨‍🏫 Teacher Model**: Guides the overall learning process.
- **🔄 Translator Model**: Helps with translation exercises.
- **🎮 Game Model**: Manages interactive learning activities.

### 4️⃣ Learning Agents System

AI agents manage:

- **✍️ Personalized Feedback**: Feedback tailored to each user’s progress.
- **📊 Progress Updates**: Keeps track of the student’s learning progress.
- **💡 Gradual Hints**: Provides hints to help the student without giving away answers.

### 5️⃣ Security and Monitoring
