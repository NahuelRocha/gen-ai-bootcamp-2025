# Efficient Prompt Creation for ChatGPT

## Key Principles

3. **Provide Context**: Give relevant context for better understanding by the model.
4. **Define Roles**: Assign a role to the model to guide the tone and response style.

## Advanced Strategies

- **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Divide tasks into smaller, more manageable parts.
- **Use Templates**: Standardize prompts using structures like RTF (Role, Task, Format) or CTF (Context, Task, Format).
- **Iterate & Refine**: Continuously improve prompts based on previous answers.

## Practical Examples

- **Content Creation**: "Act as a digital marketing expert and suggest strategies for increasing the visibility of a women's clothing store."
- **Problem Solving**: "As a software engineer, how would you optimize a mobile app's performance to reduce battery consumption?"
